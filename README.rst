TLP - Optimize Linux Laptop Battery Life
========================================
TLP is a feature-rich command line utility for Linux, saving laptop battery power
without the need to delve deeper into technical details.

TLPâ€™s default settings are already optimized for battery life, so you may just
install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP is highly customizable to meet your specific
requirements.

Starting with version 1.9 (which hasn't been released yet), TLP will be supplemented
by the *TLP profiles daemon* (TLP-PD).
It provides the D-Bus interface, which lets desktop environments show a
power profile switch with three options: *performance*, *balanced* and *power-saver*.

Together with TLP as the backend for applying these profiles, TLP-PD **replaces the
power-profiles-daemon**.
