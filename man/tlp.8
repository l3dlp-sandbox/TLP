.
.SH NAME
tlp - apply laptop power saving settings
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tlp \fIcommand\fR [\fIparameters\fR] [\fB--\fR \fICONFIG_PARAM\fR\fB=\fIvalue\fR "..."]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtlp\fR applies power saving settings manually and controls battery care
features.
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
.TP
.B start
Start \fBtlp\fR and apply the power profile for the actual power source.
Also use to apply a changed configuration or to leave manual mode.
.
.TP
.B performance
Apply the "performance" profile. Parameters ending in _AC are used.
.
.TP
.B balanced
Apply the "balanced" profile. Parameters ending in _BAT are used.
.
.TP
.B power-saver
Apply the "power-saver" profile. Parameters ending in _SAV are used.
If there is no _SAV parameter available for a feature, the _BAT parameter
will be used instead.
.
.TP
.B ac
Apply profile "performance" and enter manual mode.
Manual mode means that changes to the power source will be ignored until the
next reboot or \fBtlp start\fR is invoked to resume automatic mode.
.
.TP
.B bat
Apply profile "battery" and enter manual mode.
Manual mode means that changes to the power source will be ignored until the
next reboot or \fBtlp start\fR is invoked to resume automatic mode.
.
.TP
.B usb
Enable autosuspend for all USB devices except those excluded by default or
via configuration.
.
.TP
.B bayoff
Turn off optical drive in UltraBay/MediaBay.
The drive may be re-enabled by pulling the eject lever or pushing the media
eject button on newer models.
.
.TP
.B setcharge\fR [\fIstart_threshold stop_threshold\fR] [\fIbattery\fR]
Change battery charge thresholds temporarily.
If your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start value to 0.
Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using
\fBtlp setcharge\fR again but without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B fullcharge\fR [\fIbattery\fR]
Charge battery to full capacity.
This is done by applying vendor presets to the charge thresholds temporarily.
Configured charge thresholds will be restored at the next boot or by using
\fBtlp setcharge\fR without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B chargeonce\fR [\fIbattery\fR]
Charge battery to the stop charge threshold once.
This is done by temporarily lifting the start charge threshold.
The configured start charge threshold will be restored at the next boot or by
using \fBtlp setcharge\fR without the threshold arguments.
.
.TP
.B discharge\fR [\fIbattery\fR] [\fItarget_charge_level\fR]
Force a complete or partial discharge of the battery while on AC power.
.
.TP
.B recalibrate\fR [\fIbattery\fR]
Perform a battery recalibration while on AC power: completely discharge the
battery and recharge to 100%. The latter is done by temporarily applying vendor
presets to the thresholds. Configured thresholds will be restored at the next
boot or by using \fBtlp setcharge\fR.
.
.TP
.B diskid
Print disk ids for configured drives.
.
.TP
.B --version
Print TLP version.
.
.TP
.B --\fR \fICONFIG_PARAM\fR\fB=\fIvalue\fR "..."
Append configuration parameters to a command. These temporarily override
the system configuration during execution of that command only and are not
kept afterwards.
Disclaimer: this feature exists for the sole purpose of test automation
during TLP's development. It is provided as is and there is no support
whatsoever.
.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Availability of the above \fBbattery care\fR commands and the possible charge
threshold values always depend on laptop vendor or brand, Linux kernel version
and TLP version. Check for actual availability, threshold ranges and battery
names with \fBtlp-stat -b\fR. Follow the link in the \fBSEE ALSO\fR section for
details.

For laptops with two batteries, the secondary battery must be specified
as a command parameter in order to select it. In many cases the main battery
will be \fBBAT0\fR, the secondary battery \fBBAT1\fR. When in doubt, the output of
\fBtlp-stat -b\fR, which lists all batteries, can help.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
Change thresholds of the main battery to 70 / 90% temporarily:
.IP
tlp setcharge 70 90
.PP
Charge the secondary battery to full capacity:
.IP
tlp fullcharge BAT1
.PP
Recalibrate the main battery:
.IP
tlp recalibrate
.
